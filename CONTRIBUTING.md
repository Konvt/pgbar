# Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in this project! We welcome contributions and appreciate your help in improving it. To keep collaboration smooth and maintain code quality, please follow these guidelines:

## Bug Reports
- **Open an Issue first** if you encounter a problem.
- Include a clear description, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.

## Submitting PRs
- **Please link your PR to an existing Issue**.
- PRs without a linked Issue may not be merged immediately, but any problems raised in the PR will be treated as an Issue for discussion and tracking within the PR itself.
- Keep PRs focused on a single fix or feature, with clear commit messages and consistent code style.

## Exceptions
- **PRs that only change documentation or comments** can be submitted directly without opening an Issue.

## Communication
- Feel free to discuss implementation details in the Issue.
- We appreciate contributions and ask that you respect the project’s style and the maintainer’s decisions.
