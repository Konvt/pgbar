# Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in this project! We welcome contributions and appreciate your help in improving it. To keep collaboration smooth and maintain code quality, please follow these guidelines:

## Issues First
If you encounter a bug, unexpected behavior, or any other problem, please **open an Issue first**.
If you believe the Issue has a clear, reasonable, and small-scoped solution, you may open a Pull Request **after** the Issue is created.

## Submitting PRs
PRs related to bug reports or other problems **must be linked to an existing Issue**.
Each commit in a PR should focus on **one single change**. Keep commits concise, avoid large or sweeping changes, and follow the overall style and conventions of the project.

**All PRs should be based on the `nightly` branch and opened against it**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Exceptions
**PRs that change documentation or comments, or improve the current implementations** can be submitted directly without opening an Issue.

## Communication
Feel free to discuss implementation details in the Issue.
We appreciate contributions and ask that you respect the project’s style and the maintainer’s decisions.
